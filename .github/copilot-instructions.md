# Copilot Code Suggestion Rules

- Always suggest code that passes linter checks.
- Always include error handling in all code suggestions.
- Always follow language and framework best practices.
- For React/JSX: Use functional components, hooks, and prop-types/typescript where appropriate.
- For Node.js/Express: Use async/await, proper middleware, and input validation.
- For Python: Use type hints, docstrings, and PEP8 style.
- For tests: Ensure all code is covered by unit/integration tests and mocks are used for external dependencies.
- For all code: Prefer readability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns.
- Document public APIs and exported functions with comments or docstrings.
- Avoid deprecated APIs and patterns.
- Prefer modern language features and idioms.
- Ensure all code is compatible with project build tools and CI/CD pipelines.
